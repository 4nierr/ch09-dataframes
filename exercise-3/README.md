# Exercise-3

In this exercise, you'll practice working with data that is already
loaded into the R program.

* Transform matrix into data.frame
* find minima/maxima in data frame
* apply a function over columns

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
