# Exercise-4

This exercise uses real data (Gates Foundation's education grants 2008
to 2010).

* read data from disk
* basic data exploration
* answering questions on data (mean, max, who received max grant...)

In this exercise, you'll work with data that details. Once you read
in the data, you'll use vector operations you already know to ask real
questions about the dataset.

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
